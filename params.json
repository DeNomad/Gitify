{"name":"Gitify","tagline":"Command line toolkit to make managing a MODX site in git a lot easier.","body":"Gitify\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe goal of Gitify is to provide a **two-way sync** of data typically stored in the MODX database, making it versionable with Git. To do this, it creates a representation of MODX objects in files. These files follow a certain [human and machine friendly format](https://gist.github.com/Mark-H/5acafdc1c364f70fa4e7), built from a block of YAML, followed by a separator, and then the main content (if there's a specific content field) below that.\r\n\r\nThe project configuration, which determines what data is written to file and build to the database, is stored in a `.gitify` file in the project root.\r\n\r\n## Quick Installation\r\n\r\n```` shell\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/modmore/Gitify.git Gitify\r\n$ cd Gitify\r\n$ composer install\r\n$ chmod +x Gitify\r\n````\r\n\r\nPlease see [the Installation wiki](https://github.com/modmore/Gitify/wiki/1.-Installation) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n[Check the Wiki!](https://github.com/modmore/Gitify/wiki) It contains information about the available commands and the way you would go about setting up a suitable workflow.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contribute to the wiki by editing existing pages, or adding new pages with extra information not covered elsewhere yet.\r\n\r\n## Changes & History\r\n\r\nGitify adheres to [semver](http://semver.org). As we are before v1 right now, expect breaking changes and refactorings before the API stabilises.\r\n\r\nFor changes, please see the commit log or the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014-2015 modmore | More for MODX\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
