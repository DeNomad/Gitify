# Gitify

Welcome to the Gitify wiki! Use the navigation on the right to browse the wiki, and feel free to make improvements by editing existing pages, or creating new ones.

Introductions to Gitify:

- Video of Mark introduction Gitify at the MODX Weekend 2014, 2015-09-21. **Important:** This presentation talks about a very early version of Gitify. It has learned a lot of new tricks since! https://video.modmore.com/modx-weekend-2014/sunday-backend/staging-workflow-with-git-and-gitify/ 

- Mark's slides of the MODX Meetup in Alkmaar, The Netherlands, where he talked about how Gitify is used to build and manage Gitify. This is based on Gitify 0.9, 2015-05-21, so a lot more up to date on what you can do with it, and how you can manage a workflow with Gitify. Unfortunately, no video footage of this one. http://www.slideshare.net/hamstramark1/solving-the-workflow-building-modxtoday-with-gitify-20150521-alkmaar

- "Building MODX.today", an article published on 2015-04-22 about how the MODX.today site was built. Includes a short section about using Gitify. https://modx.today/posts/2015/04/building-modx.today
