# Установка в Windows

On Windows, some of the installation steps are bit more work, especially adding Gitify to your `PATH` variable.

This question on Stack Overflow explains the procedure of editing the PATH variable on Windows 7: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7307548/how-to-access-php-with-the-command-line-on-windows/7307581#7307581

It's common on Windows that you need to add both PHP and the Gitify executables to the PATH. 

Common locations of the PHP executable on windows include:

````
c:\php\php.exe
c:\php5\php.exe
c:\windows\php.exe
c:\program files\php\php.exe
c:\wamp\bin\php\php5\php.exe
c:\xampp\php\php.exe
